# How I Built This Website

I wanted to share the technical details behind this website for anyone curious about the architecture.

## The Tech Stack

This site is built as a **monorepo** using:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for chat
- **Payments**: Stripe for donations
- **Storage**: S3-compatible for videos

## Why a Monorepo?

Using a pnpm workspace monorepo gives several benefits:

1. **Shared code** - Types and utilities are shared between apps
2. **Consistent tooling** - Same ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configs
3. **Easy development** - Run everything with one command

## The Blog

Blog posts are written in MDX, which lets me use React components inside Markdown:

```tsx
// This is a valid MDX component!
<CustomAlert type="info">
  Hello from inside MDX!
</CustomAlert>
```

## Real-time Chat

The chat feature uses WebSockets for real-time communication. Here's a simplified flow:

1. User starts a session
2. WebSocket connection established
3. Messages are sent/received in real-time
4. AI responses are generated and streamed

## What I Learned

Building this site taught me a lot about:

- Modern React patterns with Server Components
- WebSocket best practices
- Payment integration security
- Video streaming architecture

## Source Code

The architecture is designed to be:

- **Scalable** - Each component can be scaled independently
- **Maintainable** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Secure** - Proper auth, validation, and rate limiting

Thanks for reading! Feel free to [ask questions in the chat](/chat).
